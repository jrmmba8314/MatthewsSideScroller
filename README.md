Final Project for DigiPen ProjectFun Teacher Certification

I wrote this game in conjunction with my elementary school age children.  For example, all graphics were done by them.

The game was developed using the proprietary IDE ProjectFun 1.5 created by DigiPen University.  The IDE can be found at

ProjectFun does require a paid registration in order to run.
